# polar-flow-export
Tool for bulk exporting TCX files from [Polar Flow](https://flow.polar.com/)

Requires [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (will NOT work with 3.X)

After installing Python, download [this zip](https://github.com/Luzandro/polar-flow-export/archive/master.zip), extract it and run polarflowexport.py
Exported files will be written to the folder "tcx_export" in the current working directory


Rudimentary ugly GUI for the command line tool from [Gabriel Reid](https://github.com/gabrielreid/polar-flow-export), slightly modified to make the TCX files compatible with [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/de-DE/).
